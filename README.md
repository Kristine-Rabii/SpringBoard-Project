## Capstone Project Proposal

*What is the problem you want to solve?*

In the context of a national STI epidemic, NYC health data will be analyzed to determine if there is a difference between reported number of sexual partners pre-Tinder (< 2012) and post. Additionally, whether there is a difference in the percentage of people reporting condom use at last sex, pre/post Tinder as a proxy for safe sexual practices. 

*Who is your client and why do they care about this problem?*

The client here is both public health departments and potentially dating application developers. If there is a correlation, and currently STI rates are continuing to increase, a public-private partnership advocating safer sex practices on this new social media platform may be imperative. 

*What data are you going to use for this?*

Opensource NYC health data from the most recent health data, in addition to pre-2012 health survey data. 

*In brief outline your approach to solving this problem?*

I intend to compare pre- 2012 and the most recent NYC health survey to approximate changes in sexual behavior among people living in NYC. Potentially comparing difference between reported numbers of sexual partners and the percentage of people reporting condom use at last sex, and determining if there are statistical differences between the two groups. 

*What are your deliverables?*

Code and a presentation of the characterization of participants to the NYC health survey in addition to recommendations regarding results of the analysis.
